// Task 2
// a. Scope - the scope is where the method is called from, In the method example, the scope is located in "public". 
//    some scope levels are: local-variable and the method, property, or field of a class.

// b. Static vs Non-Static - if the method is static, the information can be accessed all across the code, and if it's not static, 
//    then the information must be accessed another way. The method example is a non-static method. The key word static is used to 
//    make things static. The method example did not have the key word static, so it was a non-static method.

// c. Return Type - this is how the code returns information and defines the information from the method. The return type in this
//    method example is "double". Methods can also be void.

// d. Method Name (Identifier) - The method name in the method example is "getArea". The method name tells the code where to get the
//    information.

// e. Parameters - these are anything within the () in a method header, which the code uses to retrieve data from the method. In the
//    example, they are "double height" and "double width".

// f. Method Body - these are a set of instructions that must be executed. In the example it is "Return height * width".

// Task 3
// A user defined method is written by the user and is hidden from other methods. Methods provided with a framework can
// be used mutiple times from several locations of an application. When creating a user-defined method we should take into consideration 
// to not waste time creating something that already exists.

// Task 4
// Static methods can access all information in the code and does not need to create another object in the class.
